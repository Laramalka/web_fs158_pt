# Create a class called Dog.
# In this class, create an __init__ method that takes two parameters : name and height. This function instantiates two attributes, which values are the parameters.
# Create a method called bark that prints the following string “<dog_name> goes woof!”.
# Create a method called jump that prints the following string “<dog_name> jumps <x> cm high!”. x is the height*2.
# Outside of the class, create an object called davids_dog. His dog’s name is “Rex” and his height is 50cm.
# Print the details of his dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
# Create an object called sarahs_dog. Her dog’s name is “Teacup” and his height is 20cm.
# Print the details of her dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
# Create an if statement outside of the class to check which dog is bigger. Print the name of the bigger dog.
